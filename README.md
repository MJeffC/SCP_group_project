# Social Calendar Planner

Our group project is named "Social Calendar Planner". The project will have a login and registration page. once you are logged in you will be able to view all the events you are attending and/or will be joining in the future. With all the events that are created it will be available to all users. From the event view you will be able to view all users who are also attending the event as well. This project is made to be able to bring people together no matter where you from and show common interests to be able to coordinate a meet and greet.
